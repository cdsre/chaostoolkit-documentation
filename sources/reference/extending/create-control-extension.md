# Create a Control Extension

A control extension implements the interface defined by the Chaos
Toolkit to support the [Controls element of the specification][spec].

[spec]: ../api/experiment.md#controls

Controls are good for changing the experiment or its environment during
execution. They have the power to impact the experiment, configuration,
secrets on the fly, which is unlike probes and actions.

## Controls Interface

When implementing a control module, you must simply define a set of functions
that are called by the Chaos Toolkit when executing the experiment.

!!! tip
    All of these functions are optional, only implement the one you need.

```python
from typing import Any, Dict, List

from chaoslib.types import Activity, Configuration, \
    Experiment, Hypothesis, Journal, Run, Secrets, Settings


def configure_control(configuration: Configuration = None,
                      secrets: Secrets = None, settings: Settings = None,
                      experiment: Experiment = None):
    """
    Configure the control's global state

    This is called once only per Chaos Toolkit's run and should be used to
    initialize any state your control may require.

    The `settings` are only passed when the control is declared in the
    settings file of the Chaos Toolkit.

    pass

## Use your control

Define those functions into a module that is used as a provider. For instance,
assume the above definition is stored into a module `chaosstuff.control`, in
other words a `control.py` module of the `chaosstuff` package.

The package must obviously be available to the `PYTHONPATH` in which the
`chaos` runs.

### Declare it in the experiment

Controls can be applied per-experiment only:

=== "JSON"
    ```json
    "controls": [
        {
            "name": "my-stuff",
            "provider": {
                "type": "python",
                "module": "chaosstuff.control"
            }
        }
    ]
    ```
=== "YAML"
    ```yaml
    controls:
      - name: my-stuff
        provider:
          type: python
          module: chaosstuff.control
    ```

### Declare it in your settings

Controls can be also applied globally to all runs by declaring them in the
Chaos Toolkit settings file:

```yaml
controls:
    my-stuff:
        provider:
            type: python
            module: chaosstuff.control
```

## Things to note

### Unforeseen errors

The Chaos Toolkit will not let a control abort the execution of the experiment.
So if an exception is raised, it will be caught by the Chaos Toolkit, logged
and the execution will carry on.

### Interrupting the execution

While unforeseen errors in your controls cannot stop the execution, you can
interrupt the execution by raising `chaoslib.exceptions.InterruptExecution`
from any of your control functions.

Note however, this is a harsh way to terminate the execution since, none of
the rollbacks will be applied.

Here is an example:

```python
from chaoslib.exceptions import InterruptExecution


def after_activity_control(context: Activity, state: Run,  
                           configuration: Configuration = None,
                           secrets: Secrets = None, **kwargs):
    if check_stuff(state["output"]):
        raise InterruptExecution("Well things went really bad!")
```

In that case, the experiment's execution will have its `status` set to
`"interrupted"` as described [here][interrupted].
